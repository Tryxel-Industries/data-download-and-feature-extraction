He converted to Islam two years ago.\n\nHowever, what those reports don\u2019t mention is that the would-be terrorist also \u2018liked\u2019 numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.\n\nJameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.\n\nHe also liked a number of other far-left pages, including \u2018Trump Resistance Movement\u2019, \u2018Things Trump Supporters Say\u2019, \u2018US Democratic Socialists\u2019, \u2018Progressive Politics\u2019, and \u2018Jeremy Corbyn\u2019.\n\nSome of Jameson\u2019s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.\n\nThe jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including \u2018Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, \u2018Islam \u2013 Religion of Peace\u2019 and \u2018Stunning Hijabs\u2019, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.\n\nJameson\u2019s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.\n\nAs we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.\n\nA passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled \u2018European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists\u2019 details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.\n\nDuring the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.\n\nAccording to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.\n\nFBI field report: Antifa has improvised explosives stored on college campuses.

    public static String txt = "- Advertisement Above - - Advertisement Above -\n\nRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their \u201canatomical sex:\u201d\n\nLocal school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.\n\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.\n\nThe Occupy Democrats Election Fund is a political organization\n\nthat supports ONLY good Democratic candidates Please consider supporting the fund.
