Western officials have questioned whether Russia is actually targeting moderate rebels in a move to bolster its flagging ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nRelated: Assad Goes to Moscow to Say Thanks to Putin\n\nPutin's rating had been hovering above 80 percent since spring 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and endorsed a bloody pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith the latest VTsIOM poll, Putin's popularity is now just a notch below that of Central Asian dictators \u2014 who can often rack up between 90 and 97 percent of votes in elections.\n\nWhile VTsIOM is a respected pollster, analysts have long questioned Russian approval polls. Studies show that in authoritarian states, polls can overstate the popularity of incumbent leaders by between 5 and 20 percent because many respondents give the answers that they think are expected of them.\n\nRelated: Syrians Say Russian Airstrikes Bring 'Massive Destruction'\n\nThe latest figures come amid a prolonged economic slump. Official data released earlier this week shows Russian household income has been decreasing for the past 11 months.\n\nAlmost half of respondents in last month's VTsIOM poll last month said they expected the economic crisis to get worse.\n\nVTsIOM said it polled 1,600 people and that the poll's margin of error was 3.5 percentage points.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654im_/http://sslnodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/non-rev/nbcnews-logo.svg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654im_/http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654im_/http://sslnodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/transparent-placeholder.gif"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654im_/http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexey Eremenko"], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-hits-all-time-high-boosted-syria-n449071", "title": "Vladimir Putin's Approval Rating Hits All-Time High, Boosted by Syria Airstrikes", "meta_data": {"description": "Moscow claims the air operation in Syria is aimed at weakening ISIS.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Moscow claims the air operation in Syria is aimed at weakening ISIS.", "title": "Syria Airstrikes Boost Putin's Approval Rating to All-Time High", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-hits-all-time-high-boosted-syria-n449071", "type": "article", "image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20151022124654im_/http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "NBCNewsWorld", "title": "Vladimir Putin's Approval Rating Hits All-Time High, Boosted by Syria Airstrikes - NBC News", "description": "Moscow claims the air operation in Syria is aimed at weakening ISIS.", "creator": "NBCNewsWorld", "domain": "NBCNews.com", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-hits-all-time-high-boosted-syria-n449071", "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "news_keywords": "Vladimir Putin, Russia, Putin, Assad, Syria, airstrikes,News,World", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-22", "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1445517856.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
