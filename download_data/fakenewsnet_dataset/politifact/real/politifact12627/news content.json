Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n\nBut the plan published on Trump\u2019s website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds.\n\nIn other words, if Trump\u2019s proposals came to pass, many investment managers\u2019 tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be doing me a favor,\u201d said Scott Fearon, the president of Crown Capital Management, a hedge fund and investment fund in Greenbrae, California. \u201cHe\u2019d be cutting my taxes quite a bit.\u201d\n\nSpokesmen for Trump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment in e-mails and telephone calls. On Sunday, Trump said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that if he\u2019s elected, he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with Congress. Ultimately, tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested, he said, but he\u2019d try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses. He didn\u2019t mention his partnership proposal specifically.\n\n\u201cI will try and keep everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat I really want is lower on business, because business -- we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And I want lower on the middle class.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced Thursday when he named Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, to lead his national fundraising. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality-television star, had been largely self-funding his campaign.\n\nMnuchin declined to comment on Trump\u2019s attacks on carried interest and hedge funds. But he said he\u2019s already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support for the candidate.\n\nRate Cut\n\nSome analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump\u2019s website would actually benefit investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump\u2019s plan, \u201ccarried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.\u201d Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump\u2019s proposal: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s 15 percent rate would apply to so-called \u201cpass-through\u201d business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law.\n\nSaying the current system \u201cstifles small businesses,\u201d the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent.\n\nDebt Increase\n\nWhile Trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts, various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about $10 trillion over its first decade. While it would improve incentives for U.S. taxpayers to work, save and invest, it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless it\u2019s accompanied by large spending cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis.\n\nThe broad language of Trump\u2019s proposed 15 percent tax rate for pass-through partners will get investment managers\u2019 attention, said Bill Burnham, the founder of Inductive Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm in Reno, Nevada.\n\n\u201cYou can bet your last dollar that every hedge, private-equity and venture-capital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could,\u201d Burnham said. But he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant private-equity and hedge funds \u201cseems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point.\u201d\n\nCandidates\u2019 Calls\n\nBashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joined Trump in calling for its end, as did former Republican contenders Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeb Bush.\n\nHedge funds, investment pools open only to wealthy investors, engage heavily in short-term trading and tend to have shorter-term gains. That means their carried interest often doesn\u2019t qualify for the 23.8 percent rate, which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more. By contrast, private-equity funds put money into longer-term investments.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at \u201cspeculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital,\u201d which may not include private-equity funds. Regardless, both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under Trump\u2019s proposal. But that doesn\u2019t mean the candidate won\u2019t change it.\n\n\u201cAs far as Donald\u2019s plan, it\u2019s not a plan without far more details,\u201d said entrepreneur Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a star of ABC\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d television program. \u201cThese are talking points. Nothing more.\u201d", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/https://assets.bwbx.io/images/i7fkIksCMVFk/v1/190x-1.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iruuIgiyXNe8/v1/220x220.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iANaSLzrXUYQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iANaSLzrXUYQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lynnley Browning"], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-09/trump-s-tough-talk-on-hedge-fund-taxes-doesn-t-match-his-plan", "title": "Trump's Tough Talk on Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "type": "website", "title": "Trump's Tough Talk on Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan", "description": "Donald Trump said \u201chedge fund guys are getting away with murder\u201d when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.", "image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iANaSLzrXUYQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-09/trump-s-tough-talk-on-hedge-fund-taxes-doesn-t-match-his-plan"}, "description": "Donald Trump said \u201chedge fund guys are getting away with murder\u201d when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@bpolitics", "description": "Donald Trump said \u201chedge fund guys are getting away with murder\u201d when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.", "title": "Trump's Tough Talk on Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-09/trump-s-tough-talk-on-hedge-fund-taxes-doesn-t-match-his-plan", "image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160509103639im_/http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iANaSLzrXUYQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"status": "Donald Trump said \u201chedge fund guys are getting away with murder\u201d when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break."}, "news_keywords": "Private Equity,Tax Rate,Taxes,Hedge Funds,Donald John Trump,Donald Trump", "parsely-title": "Trump's Tough Talk on Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-09/trump-s-tough-talk-on-hedge-fund-taxes-doesn-t-match-his-plan", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iANaSLzrXUYQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-09T09:00:00.018Z", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-tags": "Private Equity,Tax Rate,Taxes,Hedge Funds,Donald John Trump,Donald Trump,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "O6Q7WX6K50XT01", "keywords": "Private Equity,Tax Rate,Taxes,Hedge Funds,Donald John Trump,Donald Trump", "sailthru.author": "Lynnley Browning", "date": "2016-05-09T09:00:00.018Z", "parsely-author": "Lynnley Browning"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1462744800.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
