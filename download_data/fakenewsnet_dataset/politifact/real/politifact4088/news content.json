The fact is, the United States economy has been stuck in a rut for a year and a half.\n\nYet a destructive passivity has overtaken our discourse. Turn on your TV and you\u2019ll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economy\u2019s short-run problems (reminder: this \u201cshort run\u201d is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead.\n\nThis gets things exactly wrong. The truth is that creating jobs in a depressed economy is something government could and should be doing. Yes, there are huge political obstacles to action \u2014 notably, the fact that the House is controlled by a party that benefits from the economy\u2019s weakness. But political gridlock should not be conflated with economic reality.\n\nOur failure to create jobs is a choice, not a necessity \u2014 a choice rationalized by an ever-shifting set of excuses.\n\nExcuse No. 1: Just around the corner, there\u2019s a rainbow in the sky.\n\nRemember \u201cgreen shoots\u201d? Remember the \u201csummer of recovery\u201d? Policy makers keep declaring that the economy is on the mend \u2014 and Lucy keeps snatching the football away. Yet these delusions of recovery have been an excuse for doing nothing as the jobs crisis festers.\n\nExcuse No. 2: Fear the bond market.\n\nTwo years ago The Wall Street Journal declared that interest rates on United States debt would soon soar unless Washington stopped trying to fight the economic slump. Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d have been used to attack any spending on job creation.\n\nBut basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed \u2014 and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent.\n\nHow have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare, declared that we must slash government spending to \u201ctake pressure off the interest rates\u201d \u2014 the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows.\n\nExcuse No. 3: It\u2019s the workers\u2019 fault.\n\nUnemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers \u2014 that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but aren\u2019t working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs.\n\nYet that\u2019s what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is \u201cstructural,\u201d they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).\n\nWell, if there really was a mismatch between the workers we have and the workers we need, workers who do have the right skills, and are therefore able to find jobs, should be getting big wage increases. They aren\u2019t. In fact, average wages actually fell last month.\n\nExcuse No. 4: We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nEverybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn\u2019t work. But what everyone knows is wrong.\n\nThink about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.\n\nSo what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isn\u2019t 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference \u2014 help for troubled homeowners \u2014 almost nothing has been done. The Obama administration\u2019s program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent.\n\nSo let\u2019s summarize: The economy isn\u2019t fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, it\u2019s because it was never actually tried.\n\nListening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, you\u2019d think the problem was \u201cno, we can\u2019t.\u201d But the reality is \u201cno, we won\u2019t.\u201d And every pundit who reinforces that destructive passivity is part of the problem.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/opinion/sectionfront/opinion_logo_large.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/circulation/icon-newspaper.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleInline.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm11/tmagazine_071411.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/25/86/ad.258614/Times_Limited_86x60.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/07/13/sports/13moth_fukushima/13moth_fukushima-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/nytimes.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/nytlogo110x16.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/1df8c48dQ2FmgIv.iOvgQ20gQ3BQ22.aAAgQ2BTQ60OQ3FA", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/27/00/ad.270010/10-1863_TR_SDN_336x79.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/07/13/arts/design/13moth_koolhaas/13moth_koolhaas-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/verticals_tmagazine.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/27/11/ad.271151/kn_static_v2_728x90.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_forward.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_reverse.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/07/13/opinion/13moth_opart/13moth_opart-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/07/12/health/MOTH13Physed/MOTH13Physed-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/07/13/world/13moth_hawass/13moth_hawass-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0/9/&t=2&s=0&ui=0&r=&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2011%2f07%2f11%2fopinion%2f11krugman%2ehtml%3fref%3dopinion"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20110714071202/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11krugman.html", "title": "No, We Can\u2019t?
