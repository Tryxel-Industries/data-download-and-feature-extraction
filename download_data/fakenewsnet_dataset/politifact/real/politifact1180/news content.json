We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs per month. Credit was frozen. And our financial system was on the verge of collapse.\n\nAs any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you, we are by no means out of the woods. A full and vibrant recovery is many months away. And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them; until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive; until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes. That is our ultimate goal. But thanks to the bold and decisive action we have taken since January, I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink.\n\nI want to thank the members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months, and especially those who have taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery. I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our nation.\n\nBut we did not come here just to clean up crises. We came to build a future. So tonight, I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future \u0096 and that is the issue of health care.\n\nI am not the first President to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last. It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform. And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.\n\nOur collective failure to meet this challenge \u0096 year after year, decade after decade \u0096 has led us to a breaking point. Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans. Some can't get insurance on the job. Others are self-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.\n\nWe are the only advanced democracy on Earth \u0096 the only wealthy nation \u0096 that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.\n\nBut the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.\n\nOne man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/24/26/ad.242613/101452_SomePromiseHD_SF_ROUND_2_336x79.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/nyt-iht-masthead-logo.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/03/21/opinion/21moth_oped/21moth_oped-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0//&t=2&s=0&ui=0&r=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ecato%2dat%2dliberty%2eorg%2freforming%2dprevious%2dreforms%2dad%2dinfinitum%2f&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2009%2f09%2f10%2fus%2fpolitics%2f10obama%2etext%2ehtml%3f", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://ad-emea.doubleclick.net/ad/N4581.281168.NEWYORKTIMES/B2336781;sz=300x250;pc=nyt157029A258644;ord=2011.03.21.11.40.30", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_forward.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/blank.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N3282.nytimes.comSD6440/B3948326.5;sz=88x31;pc=nyt156220A252821;ord=2011.03.21.11.40.30", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/thecaucus/thecaucus75.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_reverse.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/03/21/arts/music/21moth_sxsw/21moth_sxsw-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/verticals_realestate.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/nytimes.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/3c3f02a9Q2FxSAKikQ7CTYM1TcyKSBC33tTT1MYB", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/03/21/world/21moth_cleric/21moth_cleric-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/26/02/ad.260204/SanJoseRep031111.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://bs.serving-sys.com/BurstingPipe/adServer.bs?cn=bsr&FlightID=2217099&Page=&PluID=0&Pos=6674", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/24/26/ad.242614/90x79_newspaper.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/global-edition-masthead-logo-red.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm11/realestate_032111.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/25/74/ad.257451/CR_Static_120x60_NP-2.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/prescriptions/prescriptions190-nobottomma.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/03/21/magazine/21moth_key/21moth_key-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/26/03/ad.260332/11-0427_TMag_86x60.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/03/20/weekinreview/20moth_twitterature/20moth_twitterature-moth.jpg"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "title": "Obama\u0092s Health Care Speech to Congress", "meta_data": {"description": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama\u0092s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House.", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 10, 2009", "hdl": "Obama\u0092s Health Care Speech to Congress", "lp": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama\u0092s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House.", "cre": "The New York Times", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "pdate": 20090910, "dat": "September 10, 2009", "tom": "Text", "col": "Text", "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "articleid": 1247464489433, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "Article", "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "og": {"url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20110321114030/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1252533600.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
