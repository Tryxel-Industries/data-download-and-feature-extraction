She again suggested that his speeches were empty and that the first-term senator was too green to occupy the Oval Office in a time of crisis.\n\n\u201cChange has been talked about a lot in this election,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Westerville, one of her four rallies Sunday, \u201cbut change is going to happen whether we want it or not.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama often boxes careful rounds with Mrs. Clinton, rationing his jabs while striving to appear unflappable. But the primary races in Texas and Ohio could not be closer. So he noted that Mrs. Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate, a classified document available to senators, before her 2002 vote to authorize the war.\n\n\u201cIf the chairman of the intelligence committee who voted against the war says, \u2018You should read this, this is why I\u2019m voting against the war,\u2019 you should probably read it,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nSenator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, took the role of designated duelist. Mr. Rockefeller has endorsed Mr. Obama; he also voted for the war. But Mr. Rockefeller, who campaigned with Mr. Obama for part of the day, criticized those who failed to read the assessment.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of senators who should have read it,\u201d Mr. Rockefeller said, \u201cand they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe intemperate words of candidates and their surrogates came in a town that 80 years ago was considered the nation\u2019s most temperate, calling itself \u201cthe dry capital\u201d before Prohibition.\n\nNow Westerville is a well-heeled suburb of Columbus, and tends to vote Republican. Some self-described Republicans showed up at Mr. Obama\u2019s rally and spoke of abandoning their party\u2019s likely standard bearer, Senator John McCain.\n\nAmy Fleer, 36, asking Mr. Obama a question, said she was an Obama-leaning Republican. Afterward, she explained why.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t flip-flop, he doesn\u2019t attack; he\u2019s very calming and reassuring,\u201d said Ms. Fleer, who lives in Blacklick, Ohio.\n\nHer aunt and mother, lifelong Republicans, nodded heads in unison. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the same old, same old,\u201d said Janice Evans, the aunt. \u201cYou see the same people standing behind McCain that stood behind President Bush.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama addressed the traits he would look for in a Supreme Court justice, suggesting he might leaven legal scholarship with practical political experience. He held up Earl Warren, a former governor of California and the former chief justice, as an exemplar.\n\nMr. Warren, he said, had had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks.\n\n\u201cI want people on the bench who have enough empathy, enough feeling, for what ordinary people are going through,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nWhile the two Democrats battled in Ohio, Senator John McCain held a barbecue at his cabin near Sedona, Ariz. Mr. McCain, clad in a white sweatshirt with a family photograph on it, served reporters beef ribs he had prepared and grilled.\n\nAfter spending the weekend off the campaign trail \u0097 he met at his compound with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, and others \u0097 he was to return to Texas on Monday to campaign for Tuesday\u2019s primary, when his aides hope he will reach the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0//&t=6&s=0&ui=&r=http%3a%2f%2ftinyurl%2ecom%2f2nadf8&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2008%2f03%2f03%2fus%2fpolitics%2f03campaign%2ehtml%3fref%3dpolitics", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/25/86/ad.258614/Times_Limited_86x60.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/08/realestate/08moth-cover/08moth-cover-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/64a7b6a8Q2FhQ5DVG20d@sxj@GjGjGGUQ27Q2BQ22Q2BQ5DxQ275", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/07/world/07moth_tehran/07moth_tehran-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/08/fashion/08MOTH_CHAZ/08MOTH_CHAZ-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/26/42/ad.264292/Weekender_336x79.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_forward.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/global/buttons/moth_reverse.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/03/03/us/03campaign.600.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/circulation/icon-newspaper.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/07/opinion/07moth_arieff/07moth_arieff-moth.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm11/travel_050711.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/verticals_travel.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/verticalst/nytimes.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/thecaucus/thecaucus75.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/nytlogo153x23.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/07/arts/design/07moth_mcqueen/07moth_mcqueen-moth.jpg"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20110507163819im_/http://i1.nyt.com/images/2011/05/08/realestate/08moth-cover/08moth-cover-moth.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Powell"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Strong Words in Ohio as Obama and Clinton Press On", "meta_data": {"description": "Like rival warships pulling into the same small harbor, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton held rallies hours apart in Westerville.", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2008,Ohio,Obama  Barack,Clinton  Hillary Rodham,Democratic Party,Rockefeller  John D IV", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 3, 2008", "hdl": "Strong Words in Ohio as Obama and Clinton Press On", "byl": "By MICHAEL POWELL", "lp": "Like rival warships pulling into the same small harbor, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton held rallies hours apart in Westerville.", "cre": "The New York Times", "edt": "NewYork", "pdate": 20080303, "des": "Presidential Election of 2008", "per": "Obama, Barack;Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Rockefeller, John D IV", "org": "Democratic Party", "geo": "Ohio", "dat": "March 3, 2008", "tom": "News", "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "articleid": 1194751944993, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "Article", "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "thumbnail": "images/2008/03/03/us/03campaign.75.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "xlarge": "images/2008/03/03/us/03campaign.600.jpg", "xlarge_height": 320, "xlarge_width": 600, "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 600, "sec": "A", "pg": 16}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1204498800.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
