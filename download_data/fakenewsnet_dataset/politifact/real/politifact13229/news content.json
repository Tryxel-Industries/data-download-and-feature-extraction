Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.\n\nThe video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.\n\n[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump \u2018is ISIS\u2019s greatest triumph\u2019]\n\nClaiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.\n\nThe clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.\n\nOn either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.\n\n\u201cYesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,\u201d Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d\n\nThe al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201d\n\n[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]\n\nThe propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word \u201chell,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.\n\n\u201cI would hate to do it, but it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred \u2014 the absolute hatred \u2014 is coming from these areas,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)\n\nThe video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump\u2019s language aids jihadists.\n\n\u201cIf you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out \u2014 video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,\u201d Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. \u201c \u2018No Muslims coming to the United States,\u2019 other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements \u2014 it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Clinton added, \u201clights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.\u201d\n\n[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]\n\nTrump responded to Clinton\u2019s assertion by calling her \u201ca liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another Hillary lie,\u201d Trump said on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, and everybody knows that.\u201d\n\nMORE READING:\n\nMuhammad Ali on Donald Trump: \u2018Muslims have to stand up\u2019 to anti-Islamic speech\n\nWhy
