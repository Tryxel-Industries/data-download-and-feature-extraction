I've also been a leader in trying to prevent President Bush from getting us committed to staying in Iraq regardless for as long as Senator McCain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.\n\nSo, when you talk about what we need to do in Iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of America. And I believe this is in the best interest.\n\nBut I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.\n\nYou have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, I want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee. But also, do you reserve a right as American president to go back into Iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.\n\nI have been very clear in talking to the American people about what I would do with respect to Afghanistan.\n\nI think we have to have more troops there to bolster the NATO effort. I think we have to show that we are not maintaining permanent bases in Iraq because Secretary Gates, our current Defense secretary, indicated that we are getting resistance from our allies to put more troops into Afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in Iraq and I think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in Afghanistan in part because of what's happened in Iraq.\n\nNow, I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests. And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad. So that is true, I think, not just in Iraq, but that's true in other places. That's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan.\n\nI think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on Americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator, I need to reserve --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but I have -- I just have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Senator, I've got to --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Now wait a minute, I have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I've got to get us to a break because television doesn't stop.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- Iraq.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm07/nyt-logo.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/25/opinion/25moth_debate.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/25/travel/25moth-europe.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/25/arts/design/25moth_libr.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/37f2874cQ2F)lqiQ2Fge2WQ2FsoOqs6giWiqq2oi", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/global/buttons/moth_forward.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/global/buttons/moth_reverse.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0//&t=2&s=0&ui=0&r=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2008%2f02%2f26%2fus%2fpolitics%2f26text%2ddebate%2ehtml&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2008%2f02%2f26%2fus%2fpolitics%2f26text%2ddebate%2ehtml%3fpagewanted%3d13", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/02/27/us/politics/20080226_DEBATE_GRAPHIC.190.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/25/nyregion/25moth_metjournal.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/nytlogo153x23.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/19/70/ad.197082/90x79_newspaper.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/19/53/ad.195302/86x60_siteforday.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/02/26/us/0226-DEBATE-B.JPG", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/thecaucus/thecaucus75.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/adx/images/ADS/19/48/ad.194808/090280_Col_car_winner_banner_336x79.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/24/fashion/26moth_bustelo2a.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm09/travel_042509.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/ads/marketing/mm07/vertical_travel.gif"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20090425095858im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/02/27/us/politics/20080226_DEBATE_GRAPHIC.190.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "The Democratic Debate in Cleveland", "meta_data": {"description": "The following is a transcript of the Democratic presidential debate on MSNBC in Cleveland, Ohio, as provided by the Federal News Service and CQ Transcriptions via The Associated Press.", "keywords": "Clinton  Hillary Rodham,Obama  Barack,Presidential Election of 2008,Debating", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 26, 2008", "hdl": "The Democratic Debate in Cleveland", "lp": "The following is a transcript of the Democratic presidential debate on MSNBC in Cleveland, Ohio, as provided by the Federal News Service and CQ Transcriptions via The Associated Press.", "cre": "The New York Times", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "pdate": 20080226, "des": "Presidential Election of 2008;Debating", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Obama, Barack", "dat": "February 26, 2008", "tom": "Text", "col": "Transcript", "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "articleid": 1194750766534, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "Article", "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 600}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1203980400.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
