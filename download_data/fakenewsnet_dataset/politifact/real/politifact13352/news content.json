Trump, on the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, explicitly raised new questions on Wednesday about his commitment to automatically defending NATO allies if they are attacked, saying he would first look at their contributions to the alliance.\n\nAsked about Russia\u2019s threatening activities, which have unnerved the small Baltic States that are among the more recent entrants into NATO, Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have \u201cfulfilled their obligations to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they fulfill their obligations to us,\u201d he added, \u201cthe answer is yes.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United States\u2019 defense of its major allies. It was consistent, however, with his previous threat to withdraw American forces from Europe and Asia if those allies fail to pay more for American protection.\n\nMr. Trump also said he would not pressure Turkey or other authoritarian allies about conducting purges of their political adversaries or cracking down on civil liberties. The United States, he said, has to \u201cfix our own mess\u201d before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a right to lecture,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a wide-ranging interview in his suite in a downtown hotel here, while keeping an eye on television broadcasts from the Republican National Convention. \u201cLook at what is happening in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\u201d (Read the full transcript.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring a 45-minute conversation, Mr. Trump re-emphasized the hard-line nationalist approach that has marked his improbable candidacy, describing how he would force allies to shoulder defense costs that the United States has borne for decades, cancel longstanding treaties he views as unfavorable, and redefine what it means to be a partner of the United States.\n\nHe said the rest of the world would learn to adjust to his approach. \u201cI would prefer to be able to continue\u201d existing agreements, he said, but only if allies stopped taking advantage of what he called an era of American largess that was no longer affordable.\n\nGiving a preview of his address to the convention on Thursday night, he said that he would press the theme of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d his rallying cry for the past four months, and that he was prepared to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada if he could not negotiate radically better terms.\n\nWithin hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks calling into question whether, as president, he would automatically defend NATO allies, European officials who were already nervous about American commitments appeared a little stunned by his comments.\n\n\u201cSolidarity among allies is a key value for NATO,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general and a former prime minister of Norway, said in a statement. He said he did not wish to \u201cinterfere\u201d with the American election, but added: \u201cTwo world wars have shown that peace in Europe is also important for the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe United States created the 28-nation alliance, and Article 5 of the NATO treaty, signed by President Truman, requires any member to come to the aid of another that NATO declares was attacked. It has been invoked only once: NATO pledged to defend the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThat commitment has long been considered a central element of deterring attacks in Europe, especially against smaller and weaker nations like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which joined after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, one of the most pro-American allies in the region, quickly posted on Twitter evidence that his small country was meeting its defense commitments, and noted it had contributed to the mission in Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump also said he was pleased that the controversy over similarities between passages in a speech by his wife, Melania, to the convention on Monday night and one that Michelle Obama gave eight years ago appeared to be subsiding. \u201cIn retrospect,\u201d he said, it would have been better to explain what had happened \u2014 that an aide had incorporated the comments \u2014 a day earlier.\n\nWhen asked what he hoped people would take away from the convention, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m very well liked.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump conceded that his approach to dealing with the United States\u2019 allies and adversaries was radically different from the traditions of the Republican Party \u2014 whose candidates, since the end of World War II, have almost all pressed for an internationalist approach in which the United States is the keeper of the peace, the \u201cindispensable nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not 40 years ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said, rejecting comparisons of his approaches to law-and-order issues and global affairs to Richard Nixon\u2019s. Reiterating his threat to pull back United States troops deployed around the world, he said, \u201cWe are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion,\u201d citing what he called America\u2019s trade losses. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very smart to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump repeatedly defined American global interests almost purely in economic terms. Its roles as a peacekeeper, as a provider of a nuclear deterrent against adversaries like North Korea, as an advocate of human rights and as a guarantor of allies\u2019 borders were each quickly reduced to questions of economic benefit to the United States.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/22/world/22TRANSCRIPT-web1/22TRANSCRIPT-web1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/21/world/21PREXY/21PREXY-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/21/us/21trumppolicy-web/21trumppolicy-web-master768.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/21/us/21trumppolicy-web/21trumppolicy-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/20/us/20CAMPAIGN/20CAMPAIGN-thumbStandard-v4.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/07/us/NEWSEVENT-promo/NEWSEVENT-promo-blogSmallThumb.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/13/multimedia/gop-election-year-wrap/gop-election-year-wrap-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/20/us/20live-blog-refer2/20live-blog-refer2-master495-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160725163930im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/21/us/21trumppolicy-web/21trumppolicy-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David E.
