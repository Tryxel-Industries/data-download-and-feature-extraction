But one window into how the meat in fake sausages gets ground can be found in the buccaneering internet economy, where satire produced in Canada can be taken by a recent college graduate in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and presented as real news to attract clicks from credulous readers in the United States. Mr. Latsabidze said his only incentive was to make money from Google ads by luring people off Facebook pages and onto his websites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo gin up material, Mr. Latsabidze often simply cut and pasted, sometimes massaging headlines but mostly just copying material from elsewhere, including Mr. Egan\u2019s prank story on Mr. Obama. Mr. Egan was not amused to see his satirical work on Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s website and filed a copyright infringement notice to defend his intellectual property.\n\nYet Mr. Egan conceded a certain professional glee that Mr. Trump is here to stay. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got him for four years,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nBy some estimates, bogus news stories appearing online and on social media had an even greater reach in the final months of the presidential campaign than articles by mainstream news organizations.\n\nSoul Searching\n\nSince then, internet giants like Facebook and Google have engaged in soul searching over their roles in disseminating false news. Google announced that it would ban websites that host fake news from using its online advertising service, while Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined some of the options his company was considering, including simpler ways for users to flag suspicious content.\n\nIn Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.\n\nThey say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.\n\nBut those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\n\n\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.\n\nSo successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.\n\nMr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)\n\nThen the notice arrived from Mr. Egan in Canada, which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites, including departed.co, to shut them down for two days until he removed the offending story.\n\n\u201cIt was really bad for me,\u201d Mr. Latsabidze recalled. \u201cTraffic dropped and I had to start everything all over again.\u201d\n\nMr. Egan, for his part, said he did not like others making money unfairly off his labor. And he estimated that \u201cprobably half\u201d the readers of his stories believe they are true because of the widespread theft by other websites.\n\n\u201cA lot of that was conservative readers who see it picked up on other sites and believe it,\u201d Mr. Egan said. \u201cIn many cases, they haven\u2019t actually read it, they\u2019re just reacting to a headline.\u201d\n\nForm of Infotainment\n\nMr. Latsabidze said he was amazed that anyone could mistake many of the articles he posts for real news, insisting they are simply a form of infotainment that should not be taken too seriously.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call it fake news; I call it satire,\u201d he said. He avoids sex and violence because they violate Facebook rules, he said, but he sees nothing wrong otherwise with providing readers with what they want.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNobody really believes that Mexico is going to close its border,\u201d he said, sipping coffee this week in a McDonald\u2019s in downtown Tbilisi. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d\n\nAll the same, the Mexico-closing-its-border story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme. He found a tall tale about Mexico planning to call back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won. This, too, generated huge traffic, though not quite as much as the first one, which Mr. Latsabidze described as \u201ca really great story.\u201d\n\nHe insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims, whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that often appears on his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative light in the stories he posts.\n\n\u201cI am not against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw that there was interest. They are in the news.\u201d Nor, he added, is he particularly against Mrs. Clinton, though he personally prefers Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf his pro-Clinton site had taken off, he said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u201cpeople did not engage,\u201d so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u201cbecause they are angry\u201d and eager to read outrageous tales.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is all about income, nothing more,\u201d he added.\n\nThe income comes mostly from Google, which pays a few cents each time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. His best month, which coincided with the hit bogus story about Mexico closing the border, brought in around $6,000, though monthly revenue is usually much lower.\n\nMr. Obama, speaking in Berlin last week, assailed the spread of phony news on Facebook and other platforms, warning that \u201cif we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not\u201d and \u201cif we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\u201d\n\nWhile Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue, it plays a central role in driving traffic to his websites. He initially established several fake Facebook pages intended to steer traffic to his websites, including one supposedly set up by a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka. This woman, he acknowledged, does not really exist. \u201cShe is me,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe discovered, however, that such pages were ineffective compared with legitimate Facebook pages from real people, particularly Trump supporters, because they have so much energy and love promoting stories they like.\n\nDeparted.co \u2014 named after Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s favorite movie, \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and recently redirected to usatodaycom.com \u2014 published dozens of stories daily, many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline, \u201cThis Is Huuge! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros!\u201d The story was not true and had already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web.\n\nThen there are the stories that have a grain of truth, along with big dollops of exaggeration and extrapolation, like \u201cDying Hillary Says She Just Wants To Curl Up And Never Leave Her House Again After Defeat.\u201d Mrs. Clinton did say the day after her election defeat that she just wanted to curl up with a book. But she was not, as far as anyone knows, dying.\n\nKremlin Suspicions\n\nIn the prelude to the election, bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health and highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian state-controlled news media outlets and legions of pro-Russian internet agitators. This has stirred suspicions that the Kremlin has had a hand in the fake news industry, prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation.\n\nBut Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances, not Russia or anything else.\n\nHe insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help. He said that it took him just two hours to set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of computer savvy could quickly start hawking news \u2014 real or fake \u2014 online.\n\n\u201cI did not invent anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has all been done before.\u201d\n\nMr. Latsabidze, who apparently has broken no laws, said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that \u201csomething else will come along to replace it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they want to, they can control everything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will stop freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, the postelection period has been bad for business, with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary political news favoring Mr. Trump. Traffic to departed.co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent, Mr. Latsabidze said.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary had won, it would be better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write about the bad things she was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.\u201d\n\nIn the months since he got into the fake news business, Mr. Latsabidze has landed a day job as a programmer with a software company, which he sees as a better future. \u201cThis is more stable work,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he seemed reluctant to quit altogether.\n\n\u201cAre there any elections coming up in the U.K.?\u201d Mr. Latsabidze asked.\n\nHe was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon. But, advised that France will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a Trump-like candidate in the form of Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist, he perked up.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should learn some French,\u201d he said.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/20sun1/20sun1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE4/26FAKE4-master675.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-master768.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/08/us/08hack/08hack-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/19/world/disinformation-web1/disinformation-web1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/21/opinion/RFD-Fake-News/RFD-Fake-News-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE3/26FAKE3-master315.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/07/us/NEWSEVENT-promo/NEWSEVENT-promo-blogSmallThumb.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/21/business/21fakenews-top/21fakenews-top-thumbStandard.png"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20161128084252im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Higgins", "Mike Mcintire", "Gabriel J.X.
