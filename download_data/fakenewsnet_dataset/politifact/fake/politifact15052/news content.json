They weren't moving.\"\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Splash News)\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nA female student told Fox News of the distressing things she saw as police escorted her out.\n\nShe said: \"The police came through the hallway to get us and in the hallway, I saw a big pile of blood, like, kind of smeared as if they were dragged away, and I saw two girls probably dead in the hallway.\n\n\"And then, coming down the stairs, there was some more blood and outside the building there was another guy \u2013 I think it was a teacher \u2013 who was, [I\u2019m] pretty sure was dead.\"\n\nStudent Rebecca Bogart, who was in Holocaust class, told the newspaper that bullets shattered a classroom window and teens ducked for cover.\n\nRebecca, 17, said she got onto the floor and hid under a teacher's desk.\n\nShe added: \u201cFour kids in my class were hurt. There was blood everywhere. I\u2019m so glad to be living right now.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"I knew what gunshots sounded like, but not that loud or extreme. It smelled smoky.\u201d\n\nSarah Crescitelli hid in a theatre class bathroom and sent a text message to her parents reading: \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me.\u201d\n\nCruz allegedly shot his way onto the campus, and wore a gas mask and tossed smoke bombs into a corridor before pulling the fire alarm and shooting people as they ran through the haze.\n\nThere was confusion when the alarm went off, as students and staff had practiced a drill earlier in the day.\n\nThe gunman went through corridors all over the campus, shooting more victims before leaving and blending in with pupils as they fled, it was claimed.\n\nThe rampage began shortly before lessons were due to end for the day. Tales of heroism began to emerge in the hours that followed.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nSchool football coach Aaron Feis is said to have thrown himself in front of pupils to protect them during the shooting. He was reportedly in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nLanguage arts teacher Melissa Falkowski hid 19 of her students in a classroom closet as the gunman went through the school.\n\nShe climbed in after them and they hid from the suspect until it was safe to come out.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ms Falkowski hit out at the US government and society for failing to prevent the massacre.\n\nShe told CNN: \"This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen to you.\"\n\nShe added: \"We\u2019ve trained the kids what to do, and the frustration is that we did everything that we were supposed to do... and still have to have so many casualties.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nTerrified students ran out of the building, while others took refuge inside as bursts of gunfire rang out. Staff and students got on the floor in locked classrooms, with reports that the gunman shot through windows or doors.\n\nHannah Siren, 14, who was in maths class, told the Orlando Sentinel: \"The people next door to us must have not locked their door.They all got shot.\"\n\nStudent Alexa Miednik said she briefly spoke to Cruz as she and others rushed outside after the fire alarm went off and gunshots were heard.\n\nShe said: \"As we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz, and as I was speaking to him he seemed very, I don\u2019t know what the word I want to say is, but he was troubled in middle school.\n\n\"So, I kind of joked to him about it and said I\u2019m surprised you weren\u2019t the one who did it, and he just gave me a 'huh?'\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAs the lockdown was lifted after the rampage, bewildered students and staff streamed out of the school with their hands in the air, passing heavily-armed and helmeted police officers wearing combat gear.\n\nTwelve of the dead were killed inside the school, while two others were shot just outside. One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital.\n\nThe school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for several hours before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes.\n\nCruz - described by former classmates as a \"troubled\" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots.\n\nPolice said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBrent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school.\n\nHe said: \"About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what\u2019s wrong with you?'\n\n\"And he was like 'umm, don\u2019t know.' And I was like 'what\u2019s up with you?'\n\n\"He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you\u2019re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.\"\n\nStudents told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAttorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death.\n\nCruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported.\n\nThe couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: \u201cIt was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.\u201d\n\nLewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe lawyer said Cruz was \"depressed\" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in \"didn\u2019t see this coming\".\n\nA relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism.\n\nFormer classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns.\n\nThey also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.\n\nBroward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school.\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nMaths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack.\n\nHe added: \"There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.\"\n\nPhotos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as \u201cvery, very disturbing\".\n\nIt also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago.\n\nOne comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read \"I am going to what he did\" [sic].\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\nAnother YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: \"I want to be a professional school shooter.\"\n\nThe FBI were alerted to that post in September.\n\nWhen Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his \"strange talking sometimes about knives and guns\", but said \"no one ever took him seriously\".\n\nChad Williams, 18, described Cruz as \"kind of an outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns\" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: Photodisc)\n\nTrevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed \"a little off\" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.\n\nFormer schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: \"He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.\"\n\nFormer neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens.\n\nAnother former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: \u201cHe wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.\u201d\n\nWednesday's shooting ranked as the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town.\n\nLanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene.\n\nThe number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years.\n\nThere have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days.", "images":
