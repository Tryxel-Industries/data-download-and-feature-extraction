He joins the likes of Barbara Streisand, Chelsea Handler, and several others who are planning to cross the border into the land of liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau should Hillary Clinton lose. Here are 9 celebrities who say they'll move to Canada if Donald Trump becomes president: View As: One Page Slides\n\nBryan Cranston The \"Breaking Bad\" star, who previously called Trump an \"anomaly to the human race,\" told The Bestseller Experiment podcast this week that he would \"absolutely\" move to Canada if Trump is elected president. \"I would definitely move,\" he said. \"It's not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won't.\"\n\nChelsea Handler While interviewing Univision's Jorge Ramos on her Netflix talk show last month, Chelsea Handler said she is \"going to need to go to Canada if [Trump] gets elected.\" \"I don't know what the rules are to move there but a lot of us are feeling that way,\" she added. \"A lot of us are going to want to leave the country.\"\n\nStephen King In an interview with The Washington Post in September, best-selling horror fiction author Stephen King said he'd move to Canada from his home state of Maine because \"a Trump presidency scares [him] more than anything else.\" \"It scares me to death. To the point where I've actually thought of moving to Canada, which is close to Maine,\" he said. \"And I can hear a lot of my conservative friends saying, 'Ah, good! Go! Get out of here!'\"\n\nKeegan-Michael Key \"Key & Peele\" star Keegan-Michael Key once told a TMZ reporter that a Trump presidency would lead him to emigrate to Canada from his hometown in Michigan. \"It's easy,\" he said. \"It's like 10 minutes from Detroit, and that's where I'm from.\"\n\nLena Dunham If Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, \"Girls\" creator and Hillary Clinton surrogate Lena Dunham has said she'll hightail it to Vancouver, British Columbia. \"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,\" she told talk show host Andy Cohen in April (via The Hollywood Reporter). \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there.\"\n\nNeve Campbell Canadian actress Neve Campbell (\"House of Cards\") told The Huffington Post that she will \"move back to Canada\" from the US, her current residence, if Trump wins. \"It's really scary,\" she said. \"My biggest fear is that Trump will triumph.\"\n\nBarbara Streisand In a \"6o Minutes\" interview in August, Australian journalist Michael Usher asked singer Barbara Streisand what she would do if Trump became president. \"I'm either coming to your country, if you'll let me in, or Canada,\u201d Streisand said. \"He has no facts. I don't know, I can't believe it.\"\n\nNe-Yo R&B singer Ne-Yo told TMZ in October that he'll \"move to Canada straight away\" if Trump becomes the next commander-in-chief. \"Me and Drake gonna be neighbors if Donald Trump becomes president,\" he said. \"The unfortunate thing about this planet is that we are in no shortage of ignorace. I mean the fact that anybody supports [Trump] at all is ridiculous to me.\"", "images":
