The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump\u2019s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President\u2019s ice cream from the carton.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President\u2019s eating habits to the press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s borderline creepy,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he\u2019s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It\u2019s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s McDonalds habits are even weirder.\n\n\u201cHe orders the same thing every time,\u201d said the staffer. \u201cHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M\u2019s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.\u201d\n\nNo wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.)\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\n", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=68&d=identicon&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/296f03f15b8869a8eb931a2c673c9bd1?s=68&d=identicon&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5440390625_feab8a9520_z.jpg?fit=640%2C426&ssl=1&resize=40%2C40", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/82f6feeed34fe4464c5078d34d5b657e?s=68&d=identicon&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/http://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/10154950545959613/picture?type=large&_md5=bafe8e613376c9cb68665d5a75e09fa6", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cfb001c776f96d1758c6991a9bb72c79?s=68&d=identicon&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a086efa64cf70c15d75e7b383f12af8?s=68&d=identicon&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i0.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/32981471912_4af7b13b64_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1&resize=40%2C40", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1&resize=40%2C40", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/12377d03485a691d3475bbfab1be19aa?s=68&d=identicon&r=g"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915/https://halfwaypost.com/2017/07/06/white-house-chef-quits-because-trump-has-only-eaten-fast-food-for-6-months/", "title": "White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Chef Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915/https://halfwaypost.com/2017/07/06/white-house-chef-quits-because-trump-has-only-eaten-fast-food-for-6-months/", "description": "Chef Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.", "site_name": "The Halfway Post", "image": {"identifier": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1", "width": 640, "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-06T22:13:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-06T22:50:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170717160915im_/https://i1.wp.com/halfwaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/34207864335_5fd3bd61da_z.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499292000.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
