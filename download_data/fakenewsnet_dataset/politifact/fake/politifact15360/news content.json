One of the only photos she smiled in during Trump\u2019s presidency was taken at Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral alongside the Obamas and Clintons.\n\nThis week, Rudy Giuliani threw the nation a major curveball when he contradicted the president\u2019s story in an interview with Fox News. He later tried to clean up the mess by claiming that Donald was only trying to protect his marriage by burying the false allegations against him.\n\nFollowing Rudy\u2019s interview, Trump posted a multi-part tweet that had desperation written all over it. He posted the tweetstorm shortly before delivering his National Day of Prayer speech.\n\nDuring the event, people quickly noticed Melania\u2019s absence. Did Giuliani\u2019s already-infamous interview humiliate Melania to the point that she decided to avoid the event altogether?\n\nTrump and Giuliani are trying to sell people the thought that the $130,000 hush payment to Daniels was \u201cpersonal\u201d money disconnected from Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nDonald wrote, \u201cPrior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.\u201d\n\nCheck out the tweet below:\n\n\u2026despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2018\n\nWill Melania resist being seen with Donald publicly as she did after the first time Donald\u2019s affair with Daniels stole headlines?\n\nWhat is your reaction?\n\n*Please let us know in the comments section below*", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://realtimepol.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hjghfjkghjkghjk.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/https://dghcmt7iph6et.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/04/RealTime_Politics_blk_logo-1-1.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://truthclip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2017-08-20-at-3.15.46-PM.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://truthclip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MelaniaPatheticBirthday-615_3.jpg"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://realtimepol.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hjghfjkghjkghjk.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["J B"], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806/http://realtimepolitics.com/2018/05/06/melania-hit-donald-trump/", "title": "Melania Just Hit Donald Trump With Shocking Announcement He Never Saw Coming", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "fb": {"pages": 979613892126968}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Melania Just Hit Donald Trump With Shocking Announcement He Never Saw Coming", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806/http://realtimepolitics.com/2018/05/06/melania-hit-donald-trump/", "type": "article", "description": "Donald does his best to play nice with his wife when the cameras are rolling, but everyone knows that his marriage is on the rocks and that their marriage essentially enslaves Melania.\n\n\n\nIn most instances, Melania appears disgusted beyond belief when she appears alongside Donald.\u00a0 One of the on", "image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://realtimepol.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hjghfjkghjkghjk.jpg", "updated_time": "2018-05-06T15:17:16+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-06T15:17:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-06T15:17:16+00:00", "section": "Melania Trump"}, "twitter": {"title": "Melania Just Hit Donald Trump With Shocking Announcement He Never Saw Coming", "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://realtimepolitics.com/2018/05/06/melania-hit-donald-trump/", "description": "Donald does his best to play nice with his wife when the cameras are rolling, but everyone knows that his marriage is on the rocks and that their marriage essentially enslaves Melania.\n\n\n\nIn most instances, Melania appears disgusted beyond belief when she appears alongside Donald.\u00a0 One of the on", "image": "http://web.archive.org/web/20180513181806im_/http://realtimepol.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hjghfjkghjkghjk.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525557600.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
