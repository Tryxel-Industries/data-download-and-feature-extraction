Riot police at the scene were trying to restore order after fighting broke out between the two groups.\n\nSeveral people have been hurt and there have been a number of arrests.\n\nThe governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, declared a state of emergency, while the US president, Donald Trump, tweeted a condemnation of violence that appeared to be related to the scenes in Charlottesville.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\n\nThe police declared an unlawful assembly alert and a spokesman for the force said the Virginia National Guard \u201cwill closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.\u201d\n\nThe clashes came despite police efforts to keep the rival protesters apart following a confrontation late Friday in the University of Virginia\u2019s campus in which counter-protesters claimed they were hit by torches and pepper spray.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday at the park, projectiles were thrown between the groups and some of those present could be seen pushing and throwing punches, or using pepper spray.\n\nNBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGy\n\nPolice in riot gear were assembled nearby and initially stayed back from where the trouble was occurring.\n\nBy 11.15am ET, missiles such as empty bottles were being exchanged at the south-east end of the park. Far-right supporters formed a \u201cRoman tortoise\u201d shield wall at the gate. Counter-protesters cleared when a gas weapon was released.\n\n\n\nShortly later, smoke grenades were launched from the park into the crowd of counter-protesters. On both occasions, those in the street beat a hasty and uncoordinated retreat.\n\nAt around 11:40am ET, after almost an hour of missile exchanges, gas attacks and intermittent face to face melees, police declared the Unite the Right assembly illegal and cleared the park with riot troops. Largely the far right groups were compliant, but they were forced to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Counter-protesters faced far-right activists in Charlottesville.

One of their number was seen to mace a young female protester who approached the group. By the time they made it in, there were well over 500 far right protesters in the park, with around 1,000 counter-protesters in the street.\n\nStatue controversy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man wearing a \u2018Three Percent\u2019 badge joins the far-right rally in Charlottesville. Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert E Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.\n\n\n\nIt was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by around 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan\u2019s departure, and made 23 arrests.", "images":
