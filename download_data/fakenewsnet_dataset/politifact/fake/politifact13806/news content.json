PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.\n\nHouston - It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the \u201cWar of Northern Aggression.\u201d In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a \u201cfake president\u201d and Attorney General Eric Holder as \u201crabidly un-American.\u201d However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin\u2019 take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won\u2019t be our leaders. It\u2019s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it\u2019s all gonna change back. I\u2019ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don\u2019t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It\u2019s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\u201d\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter\u2019s remarks. LaPierre said, \u201cThey brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they\u2019d be better off just making me president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.\n\nSource: http://www.freewoodpost.com/2013/05/05/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/\n\nUse Facebook to Comment on this Post", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/woothemes.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/955ee9d5b08c77f44ce60008883d1f2c?s=80&d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D80&r=G", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tshirt-EmbraceHistory.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/malcolm-x-grandson-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rushcigar-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/junk-food-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jim-porter-nra-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RegisterLogin.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Mark-Ciavarella-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jim-porter-nra.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/obama-drug-war-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://graph.facebook.com/100004151973529/picture?type=square", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Shield-anti-sheeple-white-150x150.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Elizabeth-Warren-and-loans-45x45.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jim-porter-nra-300x200.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/beyonce-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/till-waye-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Ad-tshirt-sales1.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ENRON-CEO-RELEASED-large570-45x45.jpg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LogoHeader1.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Critical-Thinker-Shield-150x150.png"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jim-porter-nra.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeffrey Brown"], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054/http://urbanintellectuals.com/2013/05/07/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/", "title": "NRA President Jim Porter: \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again\u201d", "meta_data": {"generator": "WooCommerce 2.0.4", "og": {"title": "NRA President Jim Porter: \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again\u201d", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054im_/http://urbanintellectuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jim-porter-nra.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 300}, "url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20130511002054/http://urbanintellectuals.com/2013/05/07/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/", "site_name": "Urban Intellectuals", "description": "Use Facebook to Comment on this Post"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1367877600.0, "source": "http://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
