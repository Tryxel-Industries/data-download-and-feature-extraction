Late last night Greensburg police received a phone call from a worried resident saying \"she heard very concerning sounds coming from an alley way near her house\". Upon arrival officers instantly heard the noise she was talking about but never expected what they where about to see. Upon investigation they found a 21 year old male dressed as a clown eating a live cat who's legs were zip tied together. The cat was still crying for help as the individual was seemingly eating around the vital spots prolonging it's death. When he noticed the officers he started petting the cat and told the officers \"curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see if it tasted like Chinese food.\" He was non resistant during arrest however did not have identification when asked his name he always replied \"furball munchinsrein the clown\". In the holding cell it was reported he kept calling to a female officer \"here kitty kitty kitty\" she eventually approached him and said what he reportedly said \"I wonder if you taste like Chinese food come on just let me get one little bite\" and continued to bite at the cells bars. He is now in a high security prison for the criminally insane. It was reported that in the asylum he bit open his own fingers and painted himself as a clown with his own blood and refuses to answer questions and instead meows. His trial is on the 31st however police say they doubt he will ever be allowed back into society.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/b/c/a/f/f/bcaffa95f9219f8d493af47e177e588a3bbd5825.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/1/b/3/4/f/1b34f1ffae7a8287743efeee00c67e328e26571e.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/b/f/9/a/f/bf9afadbba88b8a9e0552c95dc49c133ca8c0731.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/c/1/9/f/e/c19fe3677e31f5ee3ddfacb014f1fd1685d958a7.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/7/0/b/8/c/70b8cb35fbfeadecf104225931412b6a2b70427e.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/e/a/4/a/1/ea4a18dcffbdc423784e02339ed436d98b75a876.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/5/b/e/5/2/5be52815a2d8e7fa6e3a5f4a2397b8c1c69d3438.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/7/0/1/0/4/701042849305e28fcdc088bbd0b3c88f0d1f43b8.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/b/b/f/7/d/bbf7db2844838d9f5d39dbeb82acc6a81cb54554.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/c/6/c/b/0/c6cb096520f012b2d5a3d2a6b0e0531ac4082ed7.jpeg", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/4/9/4/5/8/49458e7fd241d9e7f1276e44de7fd37ae62a0e29.jpeg"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250im_/http://www.breakingnews247.net/cache/images/c/6/c/b/0/c6cb096520f012b2d5a3d2a6b0e0531ac4082ed7.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20170916140250/http://www.breakingnews247.net/59bc13819a723/world-s-most-popular-candy-to-be-removed-from-shelves-by-october-2017.html", "title": "World's most popular candy to be removed from shelves by October 2017!", "meta_data": {"description": "The announcement was released late on Friday Sept 8th in a press conference, that the famous candy, the original Reese's peanut butter cups would no longer be available!
