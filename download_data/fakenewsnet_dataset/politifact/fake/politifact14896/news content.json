You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn\u2019t, because, well, he\u2019s delusional.\n\nBut it\u2019s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.\n\nMaybe you aren\u2019t totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there\u2019s this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.\n\n\u201cYeah, but they\u2019re the party of \u2018Blue Lives Matter\u2019 and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!\u201d you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.\n\nSalon reports, Donald Trump often declares his support, even love, for police, firefighters and other first responders. That isn\u2019t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.\n\nBuried in the hastily drafted tax bill\u2019s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.\n\nThis year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.\n\nAdd police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.\n\nShameful.", "images": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/evtt-100x100.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mitchmcconnell4-80x80.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/qxdss-80x80.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/reqw-e-100x100.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crww.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wrre-100x100.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c67452a34ea02b33f29fd830e5b85b46?s=45&d=mm&r=g", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eotvw-80x80.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/evv-80x80.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bddlogo.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crww-100x100.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wtvqwt-100x100.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trump-dad-80x80.png"], "top_img": "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crww.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/trump-police-officers-and-firefighters-make-too-much-money-hits-them-with-tax-penalty/", "title": "Trump: Police Officers and Firefighters Make Too Much Money\u2026Hits Them with Tax Penalty", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://web.archive.org/web/20171230025116im_/http://www.bluedotdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crww.png", "width": 810, "height": 450}, "type": "article", "description": "We all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics.
